                    <p>My name is Julian Elmasry. I am currently a sophomore at Stony Brook University and am declared as a Computer Engineering major.  I have a passion for creating. 
                      At the moment I am learning Java as well as Python. 
                      The idea of creating a working program/website from absolutely nothing is 
                      incredible to me.  </p></td>

         <ul><li><a href = "https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/students/Undergraduate-Studies/courses/CSE114"><b>CSE 114</b></a></li><p>An introduction to procedural and object-oriented programming methodology. Topics include program structure, conditional and iterative programming, procedures, arrays and records, object classes, encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, file I/O, and exceptions. Includes required laboratory. This course has been designated as a High Demand/Controlled Access (HD/CA) course.</p><br><li><a href = "https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/students/Undergraduate-Studies/courses/CSE214"><b>CSE214</b></a></li><p>CSE214 is an introduction to data structures and algorithms, and an extension of programming methodology to data storage and manipulation of complex data sets. Topics include: programming and applications of data structures; stacks, queues, lists, binary trees, heaps, priority queues, balanced trees and graphs. Recursive programming is heavily utilized. Fundamental sorting and searching algorithms are examined along with informal efficiency comparisons.</p><br><li><a href = "https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/students/Undergraduate-Studies/courses/ISE218"><b>ISE 218</b></a></li><p>This course introduces the fundamentals of Information Technology (IT) to students interested in the relationship between computer hardware, software, networks, and information systems. The course examines components found in high use computing devices such as desktop computers, smart phones, and navigation systems. The focus of the examination is understanding the underlying technology of each component, along with price/performance curves and competing technologies. Upon completion of the course, students should be proficient in reading device specifications, particularly functional and performance implications.</p></ul>
